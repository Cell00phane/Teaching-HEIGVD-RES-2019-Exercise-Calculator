The first goal is to **specify a client-server protocol**, which will allow a client to ask a server compute a calculation and to return the result. 

The specification must contain everything that is needed for **one person to implement a client**, for **another person to implement a server** and for the 2 applications to work together. The specification is a contract between the server and the client.

## Phase 1: write the specification (15 minutes)

* Protocol: TCP

* Port: 55
